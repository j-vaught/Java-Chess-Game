Welcome to our open-source Java Chess Game. Designed with the open-source community in mind, we invite developers and chess enthusiasts alike to join us in creating an outstanding user experience and robust gameplay.

Our GUI leverages UTF-8 for displaying chess symbols, creating an intuitive interface that eases navigation for all users. Whether you're a chess newbie or a seasoned veteran, we have you covered.

An integral part of our project is the move-suggestion system. It helps you identify both advantageous and potentially disadvantageous moves, adding a level of strategy and depth to every game.

In designing the interface, we've gone through several iterations to bring it up to par with modern graphical interface standards in Microsoft Windows. We're continually evolving the design to create a chess game that is visually engaging and user-friendly.

One of the distinguishing features of our game is the networking functionality. This capability allows for chess matches between two computers on the same network, creating opportunities for exciting competition and collaborative play.

Adding an element of intrigue to the game, our chess simulator can predict player moves one step ahead. This feature introduces a fresh layer of strategy that will keep you engaged and planning for every eventuality.

The development of this chess game has involved extensive testing to ensure a seamless, bug-free gaming experience. But, as part of the open-source ethos, we welcome your contributions to improve the project further.

Join us on this exciting journey. Fork, clone, commit, and pull request your way into the ongoing development of this open-source Java Chess game. Together, we can make it better and more engaging for the community!
